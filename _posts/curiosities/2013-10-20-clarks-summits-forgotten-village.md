As I do every morning, today I glanced at the local newspaper's website.  Cool, the Sunday [local history piece](http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/local-history-ghosts-on-the-map-1.1570941) was about ghost towns.  It begins:

> Old-timers say that if you take a walk in the wooded area near Maple Avenue and South Abington Road [in Clarks Summit, PA], you might catch a fleeting glimpse of a shadowy figure toting a rifle. [...] Locals know it as the Forgotten Village.

Wait ... what?!  I lived in Clarks Summit for two decades, a fanatic for all things abandoned and nearly forgotten, and this is the first I'm hearing of it?

A Google search had nothing to offer.

In search of more information I e-mailed my mother, who grew up across the road and north a block.  It was a long shot, since my mother is *not* really a fan of poking around in abandoned places.

But she surprised me.  She recalled walking there as a little girl with her father, entering the woods just past the old Lithuanian cemetery, and coming across decaying structures and—she's almost positive—a still-standing bungalow.  That would have been in the mid 1950s.

This "forgotten village" was a source of stories, devised by junior high school boys, about crazed men with guns "back in those woods." The newspaper article refers to it as a possible late 19th century Russian settlement, but my mother has no memory of that.

Of course I intend to investigate the area for myself, but please leave a comment if you have information, memories or stories about Clarks Summit's "Forgotten Village." All possible sources of information are most welcome!
