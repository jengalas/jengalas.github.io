Today's visit to the Home Despot yielded two new plants for the collection—both *Mammillaria*. The first one I spotted was a *M. gracilis ssp. fragilis*. This is such a commonly sold plant that I never felt the urge to buy one at any given time, figuring I could always order one from a reputable seller online. But for some reason I never did, although I actually really like this plant. Today this nice cluster appeared, flowering pale yellow, and I couldn't resist. It should be a treat to repot, because the little segments pop off if you look at them sideways, which is to say, even easier than the segments of *Tephrocactus*. But like *Tephros*, the segments root readily. Mamms aren't known for their flowers, but I like the way these flowers dot the cluster with bursts of yellow. And their rounded petals are a change from the usual pointed Mamm petals.

The second cluster was Rich's pick. I'm fascinated by the geometric shapes—one of the neatest features of *Mammillaria* as a group. We don't know yet whether this is one plant with three heads, or three cactuses planted together. I won't find out for sure until I repot it in the spring. If it truly is *Mammillaria elegans*, as the ever-dubious Altman label indicates, I suspect it's three separate plants. Time will tell.

In bonus *Mammillaria* news, today our *Mammillaria plumosa* opened its first flower! The bloom is pale beige with hints of pink, and has the typically unimpressive Mamm flower form. But unlike most cactus flowers, it has a blissful fragrance!
