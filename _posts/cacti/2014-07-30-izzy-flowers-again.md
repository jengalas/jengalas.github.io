Izzy is our reliable *Parodia magnifica*. He’s one of the first cacti we bought, and my early cultivation mistakes show in the tough corking near Izzy’s base. Over the winter, shrunken in dormancy, he looked anything but “magnifica.” But the new growth he has put on since May is nice and plump and green, and Izzy thrilled us today with this delicate lemon-yellow blossom. The best part? The sweet fragrance of the flower! And there’s a second bud waiting in the wings.
