excerpt: "We'll give this pale, neglected cactus a good chance!"

Rich and I noticed this poor cactus at the back of the bottom shelf of a wooden rack in Lowe's garden section. We had to pull out several trays of other cacti just to reach it.  The pale color is probably a result of being in low light for a significant amount of time. At least it wasn't overwatered and doesn't exhibit etiolated growth. 

The plant is labeled *Trichocereus grandiflorus*, which I'm pretty sure it's not. (Altman's grows nice plants, but their identifications are often wrong.) It's some type of Echinopsis—perhaps what used to be called *Sohrensia*—but we don't know which one.
