This adorable cactus was a gift from a colleague in appreciation for my work on a complex web development project. She had no idea that Rebutias are some of my favorite cactuses and yet I have only one other cactus from the genus. Our guess is that it is *Rebutia fulviseta*, based on the flowers, the shape of the body of the plant, and its dark-green-to-violet skin. But I welcome corrections!
