excerpt: "Like other Opuntioideae, Tephrocactus root quickly ... but I never expected it to be this fast!"

It took fewer than ten days for the tephrocactus segment that <a href="/cacti/pop-goes-the-tephrocactus-segment/">fell off our larger plant</a> earlier this summer to root. A week or two later it started to produce a new segment! Our plan is to eventually put it back into the pot with the mother plant.
