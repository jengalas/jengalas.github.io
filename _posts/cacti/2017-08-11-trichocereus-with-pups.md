This morning Rich and I returned to Lowe's in search of a cactus that I saw last time but wasn't ready to purchase. It was an *Oreocereus trollii*, but what made it a bit special was that it had an arm. I have several *Oreocereus* already, and I was torn about whether I should buy it. I decided that I would come back in a few weeks and if it was still there, I'd buy it.

Well, unfortunately it was gone, and I didn't see much else there that I wanted to buy. But at Home Depot, I saw this small *Trichocereus* with the cutest little pups just peeking up above the surface of the soil. I couldn't resist. When I got home I cleaned the roots in preparation for potting in my favorite mix.
