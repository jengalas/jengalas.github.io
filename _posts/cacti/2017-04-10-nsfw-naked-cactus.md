excerpt: "Seed-grown *Stenocereus* cleaned and ready for repotting"

Thought you might like a quick update on the *Stenocereus* we <del>bought at</del> rescued from Walmart [earlier this year](/two-new-cuties/). His roots are cleaned (with the exception of a few specks of peat that I'll brush off once it's completely dry) and ready for repotting. Rich and I always call these guys "naked cacti." Who knows, maybe they like going commando ...

My method for repotting is to first remove all peat-based soil from the roots. I use a garden hose. I start out gentle, but you'd be surprised what most cactus roots can take without breaking. I typically hold the cactus in (or rest it on) soft foam while I hose off the soil. Then, still resting on foam and paper towels, the cactus is left to dry for a day or so. Once the roots are dry, I repot into my own mix, which is a mainly mineral mix of pumice with a small amount of Black Gold cactus mix (California formulation only!). Wait at least 10 days before watering the repotted cactus to reduce the risk of fungal infection entering through damaged roots! 

(In response to my previous post, as you can see, he was seed-grown.)
